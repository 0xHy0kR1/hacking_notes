## Introduction
- downloading files from the internet is not as secure as it will seem at first glance.
- Another way to deliver malicious codes to the target computer is through “BDFProxy.”

**BDFProxy is a device created by combining two unique tools made by Joshua Pitts.**
- The first tool is called "The Backdoor Factory" (BDF), and its purpose is to automatically modify files so that they include code to establish a connection back to the attacker.
- The second tool is called "mitmproxy," and it acts as a middleman for internet traffic. It can intercept and understand HTTP data, modify it on the fly, replay previous traffic, and analyze basic data types.

By combining these two tools, BDFProxy was born. It can perform the functionalities of both tools, allowing users to automatically modify files with connection code while also acting as a middleman to manipulate internet traffic for testing and analysis purposes.

**Before to use this tool, we need to make some adjustments in “bdfproxy.cfg”**
	- file by changing “proxy Mode” to “transparent” and set our IP address (the attacker’s IP address) under the available hosts.**
	- To do so, type in the terminal _“leafpad /etc/bdfproxy/bdfproxy.cfg”_ and make changes like in the images below.
