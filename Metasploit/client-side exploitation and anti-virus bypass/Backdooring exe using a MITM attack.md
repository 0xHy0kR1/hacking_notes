- **ARP Spoofing attack** - In this case, the attacker uses the MITM framework to perform an ARP spoofing attack. It means the attacker tricks the Windows 10 target machine into thinking that the attacker's machine is the legitimate network gateway, allowing the attacker to intercept and manipulate network traffic.
- **SSLstrip** - 
	- It is a tool that helps in bypassing the security provided by HTTPS connections.
	- Normally, when you visit a website with "https://" in the URL, it means the connection is secure. However, SSLstrip allows the attacker to convert these secure connections (HTTPS) into insecure connections (HTTP) without the user's knowledge.
