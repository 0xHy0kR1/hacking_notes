What if you Trigger a database error when the injected SQL query is executed no longer causes any difference in the application's response, so the preceding technique of inducing conditional errors will not work.

- SQL queries are generally processed synchronously by the application, delaying the execution of a SQL query will also delay the HTTP response
- This allows us to infer the truth of the injected condition based on the time taken before the HTTP response is received.

```sql
'; IF (1=2) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'-- 
'; IF (1=1) WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:10'--
```
The first of these inputs will not trigger. The second input will trigger a delay of 10 seconds

Using this technique, we can retrieve data in the way already described, by systematically testing one character at a time:

```sql
'; IF (SELECT COUNT(Username) FROM Users WHERE Username = 'Administrator' AND SUBSTRING(Password, 1, 1) > 'm') = 1 WAITFOR DELAY '0:0:{delay}'--
```

## Steps to solve Lab-1
### Desc - Blind SQL injection with time delays

1. First confirm that the parameter(tracking-id) is vulnerable to blind SQLi
Vulnerable parameter - tracking cookie(tracking-id)

2. Now, we are going to perform a query of 10 seconds of delay:
   query --> 
   ```sql
   ' || pg_sleep(10)--
```
