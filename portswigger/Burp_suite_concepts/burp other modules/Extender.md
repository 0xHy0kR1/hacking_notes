## Introduction
- The Up and Down buttons in this section control the order that installed extensions are listed in.
- Extensions are invoked in _descending_ order based on this list. In other words: all traffic passing through Burp Suite will be passed through each extension in order, starting at the top of the list and working down.

- Bottom window can be used to view module information, as well as for debugging.

## The BApp store
- The Burp App Store (or BApp Store for short) gives us a way to easily list official extensions and integrate them seamlessly with Burp Suite.
- Switch over to the "BApp Store" sub-tab, then search for "Request Timer". There should only be one result. Click on the returned Extension, then click "Install":
