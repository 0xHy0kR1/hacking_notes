- An authoritative DNS server is the server that is responsible for storing the DNS records for a particular domain name and where any updates to your domain name DNS records would be made.
- The authoritative server is often also known as the nameserver for the domain. For example, the name server for [tryhackme.com](http://tryhackme.com) is [kip.ns.cloudflare.com](http://kip.ns.cloudflare.com) and [uma.ns.cloudflare.com](http://uma.ns.cloudflare.com). You'll often find multiple nameservers for a domain name to act as a backup in case one goes down.
- Authoritative name servers are used to store DNS records for domains directly. In other words, every domain in the world will have its DNS records stored on an Authoritative name server somewhere.
