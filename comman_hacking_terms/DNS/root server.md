- The root servers act as the DNS backbone of the internet; their job is to redirect you to the correct Top Level Domain Server, depending on your request.
- for example, you request [www.tryhackme.com](http://www.tryhackme.com/), the root server will recognise the Top Level Domain of .com and refer you to the correct TLD server that deals with .com addresses.
