- HTA stands for "HTML Application".
- It is a file format used for creating windows-based applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- HTA files are essentially standalone applications that run on Windows OS and are executed by Microsoft's HTML Application Host(mshta.exe).
- HTA files can be used to create simple applications such as calculators, text editors, and games, etc.
- HTA records help to bypass antivirus since they are still not well identified.
- HTA can also be used in web phishing, replacing old Java Applet attack.
**Note** - It's worth noting that HTA files are not supported by all web browsers and are primarily designed to run on Windows operating systems.
