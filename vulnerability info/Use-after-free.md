- A use-after-free vulnerability is a type of software vulnerability that occurs when a program continues to use a memory address after that memory has been freed or deallocated.
- This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as crashing the program, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code, or gain unauthorized access to a system.
