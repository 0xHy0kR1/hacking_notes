# Nikto
- Nikto is an open-source command-line vulnerability scanner that scans web servers for potentially dangerous files, outdated versions, server configuration files, and other problems.

- It is not a stealthy tool, which means it will look in the fastest way possible, and it will get detected by an IDS(if you need a stealthy tool, try [nmap on Kali](https://cdn.linuxfordevices.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/How-to-use-Nmap-in-Kali-Linux.png) instead).

- Nikto comes with SSL support, Full HTTP Proxy support, and saves reports in plain text, HTML, XML, etc
