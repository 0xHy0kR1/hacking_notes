## Pre-requisite -->  [[buffer overflow]]

## Steps to conduct a buffer overflow:
1. Spiking:
	- It is a method that we use to find a vulnerable part of a program. In spiking we don't know which command is vulnerable and try on every single command and try to break it.

2. Fuzzing:
	- In fuzzing, we send a bunch of characters at a program and see if we can break it. Fuzzing and spiking both are same and both send bunch of characters, but the difference is that, in fuzzing we know which command is vulnerable.

3. Finding the Offset:
	- If we break it, then we find at what point we break the program that is our **Offset** and we use that Offset to overwrite the **EIP**(The pointer address).

4. Overwriting the EIP:
5. Finding Bad Characters:
	- Once we have the  EIP controlled, we need to do a few house cleanup things one is called finding bad characters and the other is called finding the right module.
	- Finding bad character means we're finding which char is good for shellcode and which character is not good for shell code by continuously trying large number of hex characters.

7. Finding the Right module:
	- When we say finding the right module what we're saying is we're looking for a DLL or something similar that has no memory protection. To find right module, we have a tool called mona modules.
1. Generating Shellcode
2. Root:
	- We're going to point that EIP to our malicious shell code and hopefully we're gonna gain root.
