## Pre-requisite -->  [[buffer overflow]]

![[anatomy_of_stack1.png]]
## Steps to conduct a buffer overflow:
1. Spiking:
	- It is a method that we use to find a vulnerable part of a program. In spiking we don't know which command is vulnerable and try on every single command and try to break it.

2. Fuzzing:
	- In fuzzing, we send a bunch of characters at a program and see if we can break it. Fuzzing and spiking both are same and both send bunch of characters, but the difference is that, in fuzzing we know which command is vulnerable.

3. Finding the Offset:
	- If we break it, then we find at what point we break the program that is our **Offset** and we use that Offset to overwrite the **EIP**(The pointer address).

4. Overwriting the EIP:
5. Finding Bad Characters:
	- Once we have the  EIP controlled, we need to do a few house cleanup things one is called finding bad characters and the other is called finding the right module.

6. Finding the Right module
7. Generating Shellcode
8. Root:
	- We're going to point that EIP to our malicious shell code and hopefully we're gonna gain root.
