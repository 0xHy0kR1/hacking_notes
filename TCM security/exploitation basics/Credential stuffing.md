- Credentials stuffing refers to a cyber attack method used by malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to user accounts on various online platforms, such as websites, applications, or services.
- It involves using a large number of username and password combinations, typically obtained from previous data breaches, and attempting to log in to different user accounts using automated tools or scripts.
- The attackers exploit the fact that many people reuse the same username and password across multiple online platforms. They use automated software to rapidly input the stolen credentials into login forms of various websites or applications, hoping that some users have reused their passwords.
