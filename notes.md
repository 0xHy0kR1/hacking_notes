boxname/

boxname/scans/   - for nmap and other tool scan output

boxname/report/  - notes.txt goes here, if i'm writing a report, I put screenshots in here as well. Autorecon creates notes.txt with a line per open port

boxname/loot/ - files I grab from the box i'm working on. i'll either mirror a directory structure, or just use underscores if I'm not grabbing a ton of files. Something like loot/etc_passwd 

boxname/exploits/ - any exploits I download or write or otherwise just even try.
