1.  Open a terminal window.
2.  Type the following command and press Enter: `sudo netstat -tuln`
3.  Look for the IP address and port mentioned in the error message (e.g., 192.168.1.6:80) in the "Local Address" column. Note the PID (Process ID) associated with that IP address and port.
4.  Use the `kill` command with the PID noted in step 3 to stop the process. For example: `sudo kill <PID>`.
