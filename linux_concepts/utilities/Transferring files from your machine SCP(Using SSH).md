- this command allows you to transfer files between two computers using the SSH protocol to provide both authentication and encryption.
- SCP allows you to:
	- Copy files & directories from your current system to a remote system
	- Copy files & directoriesÂ from a remote system to your current system
- Provided that we know usernames and passwords for a user on your current system and a user on the remote system

2. using `scp` to copy a file from a remote computer that we're not logged into
