##### Symmetric encryption 
- **Symmetric encryption** uses the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data.
- Examples of Symmetric encryption are DES (Broken) and AES.
- These algorithms tend to be faster than asymmetric cryptography, and use smaller keys(DES keys are 56 bits long).

##### Asymmetric encryption
- **Asymmetric encryption** uses a pair of keys, one to encrypt and the other in the pair to decrypt.
- Examples are RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
- Normally these keys are referred to as a public key and a private key.
- Data encrypted with the private key can be decrypted with the public key, and vice versa.
- Asymmetric encryption tends to be slower and uses larger keys, for example RSA typically uses 2048 to 4096 bit keys.
