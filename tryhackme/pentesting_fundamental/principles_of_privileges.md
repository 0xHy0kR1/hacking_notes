Two key concepts are used to assign and manage the access rights of individuals, two key concepts are used: Privileged Identity Management (PIM) and Privileged Access Management (or PAM for short).

### PIM - 
- Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a security practice that focuses on managing and controlling the access rights and permissions of privileged accounts within an organization.
- Privileged accounts are those with elevated permissions that allow individuals to perform tasks that can affect critical systems, data, and configurations.
**The main objectives of PIM are to:**
- Minimize the risk associated with unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.
- Control and monitor activities performed by privileged users to prevent misuse or abuse of their privileges.
- Enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring that users have only the access necessary for their roles.

### PAM - 
- PAM goes beyond just managing accounts and focuses on controlling and securing privileged access across the entire organization.
- It involves processes, technologies, and policies designed to safeguard critical systems, applications, and data from unauthorized access.
**PAM typically includes the following components:**
- **Credential Vaulting:** Secure storage and management of privileged account credentials to prevent their exposure.
- **Password Rotation:** Regularly changing passwords for privileged accounts to mitigate the risk of compromised credentials.
- **Session Monitoring:** Tracking and recording activities performed during privileged sessions for audit and compliance purposes.
- **Just-in-Time Access:** Granting temporary access to privileged accounts only when needed, reducing the attack surface.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Adding an extra layer of security by requiring multiple forms of authentication to access privileged accounts.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Assigning access permissions based on job roles to ensure the principle of least privilege.
- **Behavioral Analytics:** Monitoring user behavior to detect any unusual or suspicious activities.
