## Github:
You can use GitHub's search feature to look for company names or website names to try and locate repositories belonging to your target. Once discovered, you may have access to source code, passwords or other content that you hadn't yet found.

## S3 Bucket
- S3 Buckets are a storage service provided by Amazon AWS, allowing people to save files and even static website content in the cloud accessible over HTTP and HTTPS.
- The owner of the files can set access permissions to either make files public, private and even writable.
- S3 buckets can be discovered in many ways, such as finding the URLs in the website's page source, GitHub repositories, or even automating the process.
- One common automation method is by using the company name followed by common terms such as **{name}**-assets, **{name}**-www, **{name}**-public, **{name}**-private, etc.
