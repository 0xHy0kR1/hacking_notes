At this stage, we have two basic options for privilege escalation: reading the `/etc/shadow` file or adding our user to `/etc/passwd`.

## reading the `/etc/shadow` file

   - We see that the nano text editor has the SUID bit set by running the `find / -type f -perm -04000 -ls 2>/dev/null` command.
   - We can now use the unshadow tool to create a file crackable by John the Ripper. To achieve this, unshadow needs both the `/etc/shadow` and `/etc/passwd` files.

The unshadow toolâ€™s usage can be seen below;  
```sh
unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > passwords.txt
```
With the correct wordlist and a little luck, John the Ripper can return one or several passwords in cleartext.

## Adding new user with root privilege

   - We will need the hash value of the password we want the new user to have. This can be done quickly using the openssl tool on Kali Linux.

   - We will then add this password with a username to the `/etc/passwd` file.

Once our user is added, we will need to switch to this user and hopefully should have root privileges.
