Config files often contain passwords in plaintext or other reversible formats.

**List the contents of the user's home directory:**
```python
ls /home/user
```

**Note the presence of aÂ "myvpn.ovpn" config file. View the contents of the file:**
```python
cat /home/user/myvpn.ovpn
```
The file should contain a reference to another location where the root user's credentials can be found.

**Switch to the root user, using the credentials:**
```python
su root
```
