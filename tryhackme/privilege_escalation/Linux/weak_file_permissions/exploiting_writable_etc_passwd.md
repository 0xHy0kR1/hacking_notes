Continuing with the enumeration of users, we found that **user7** is a member of the **root** group with **gid 0.** And we already know from the **LinEnum** scan that **/etc/passwd** file is writable for the user. So from this observation, we concluded that **user7** can edit the /etc/passwd file.

## Understanding /etc/passwd
The /etc/passwd file stores essential information, which  is required during login. In other words, it stores user account information(some useful information like user ID, group ID, home directory, shell, and more... ).

## Understanding /etc/passwd format
- The /etc/passwd file contains one entry per line for each user (user account) of the system.
- All fields are separated by a colon : symbol. Total of seven fields as follows.

1. **Username**: It is used when user logs in. It should be between 1 and 32 characters in length.

2. **Password**: 
	- An x character indicates that encrypted password is stored in /etc/shadow file.
	- Use a special command called "passwd"(This command turns your password into a secret code (hash) for security) to change or create passwords. When you type a password on the computer's command line. The secret code is saved in a secure file called "/etc/shadow." This way, passwords are hidden and protected, making it harder for bad actors to access them.

3.  **User ID (UID)**: 
	- Each user must be assigned a user ID (UID). 
	- UID 0 (zero) is reserved for root and UIDs 1-99 are reserved for other predefined accounts.
	- Further UID 100-999 are reserved by system for administrative and system accounts/groups.

4. **Group ID (GID)**:
	- The primary group ID (stored in /etc/group file)

5. **User ID Info**:
	- The comment field. It allow you to add extra information about the users such as user’s full name, phone number etc. This field use by finger command.

6. **Home directory**:
	- The absolute path to the directory the user will be in when they log in. If this directory does not exists then users directory becomes /.

7. **Command/shell**:
	- The absolute path of a command or shell (/bin/bash). Typically, this is a shell. Please note that it does not have to be a shell.

## How to exploit a writable /etc/passwd?
It's simple really, if we have a writable /etc/passwd file, we can write a new line entry according to the above formula and create a new user! We add the password hash of our choice, and set the UID, GID and shell to root. Allowing us to log in as our own root user!

#### Performing the above practically
1. Add new user to the root group but first create a compliant password hash to add! We do this by using the command: **"openssl passwd -1 -salt [salt] [password]"**
```python
user7@polobox:~$ openssl passwd -1 -salt new 123
```
