## Pre-requisite --> [[grpc overview]]
- we conduct CTFs internally. And thus, we created a CTF on exploiting SQL injection in gRPC.
- Now, ideally, SQL injection in web applications occurs when an exploit is passed in the user input which further gets passed on to the backend server for exploitation.
- In case of gRPC, it was kind of same. The vulnerable Blog application was also offering CRUD operations. The attacker had to get hold of one such service and exploit their way up to capture the flag.

## Tool Requirements (Supports gRPC)
   - Go Language installed
   - GRPC UI
   - GRCP CLI
   - Burpsuite

## Target instance
   - 127.0.0.1:50051

Let’s take the instance of target **127.0.0.1:50051** for this blog

>We will first try to list out the blogs available to us in the target scope by using the below command :
```sh
grpcurl -plaintext 127.0.0.1:50051 list
```

![[grpc6.webp]]
Now we are able to see that the blog service is up and running.


>we will now check about the list of services running on gRPC server by using the below command:
```sh
grpcurl -plaintext 127.0.0.1:50051 list blog.BlogService
```

>Now we will create a blog using the GRPC UI tool and for this we will use the command as follows:
```sh
grpcui -plaintext 127.0.0.1:50051
```

![[grpc8.webp]]


**This command will initiate a UI portal on which we can provide our data to create or modify our blog. There are other operations also which we can use from this portal.**

**From here click on update blog and capture the request and in the author id section of the captured request insert a SQL injection payload as below –**
![[grpc10.webp]]
You can observe the temporary flag value is being returned in the response.
