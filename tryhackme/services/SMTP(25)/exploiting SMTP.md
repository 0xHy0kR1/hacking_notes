## Pre-requisite --> [[SMTP enumeration]]

## Hydra
- We're just going to brute-force SSH.
- Hydra uses dictionary attacks(many different wordlists in the "_/usr/share/wordlists_" directory)
- check out SecLists for a wider array of other wordlists that are extremely useful for all sorts of purposes, other than just password cracking. E.g. subdomain enumeration

### Syntax
```python
hydra -t 16 -l USERNAME -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV MACHINE_IP ssh
```


	- hydra --> Runs the hydra tool

	- -t 16|Number of parallel connections per target

	- -l(user) --> Points to the user who's account you're trying to compromise

	- -P(path to dictionary) --> Points to the file containing the list of possible passwords

	- -vV --> Sets verbose mode to very verbose, shows the login+pass combination for each attempt

	- (machine IP) --> The IP address of the target machine

	- ssh / protocol --> Sets the protocol

## SMTP exploitation practically:
1. Doing ssh brute-forcing to find the password of administrator:
   command - 
```python
root@ip-10-10-182-76:~# hydra -t 16 -l administrator -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV 10.10.214.226 ssh
```
