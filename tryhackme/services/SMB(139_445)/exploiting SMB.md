In this case, we're going to be exploiting anonymous SMB share access- a common misconfiguration that can allow us to gain information that will lead to a shell.

**Method Breakdown**
So, from our enumeration stage, we know:

    - The SMB share location

    - The name of an interesting SMB share

## SMBClient
- Because we're trying to access an SMB share, we need a client to access resources on servers.

### Syntax 
```python
smbclient //[IP]/[SHARE]
```
