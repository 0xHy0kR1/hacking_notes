1. Enumeration is the process of gathering information on a target in order to find potential attack vectors and aid in exploitation.
2. Enumeration can be used to gather usernames, passwords, network information, hostnames, application data, services, or any other information that may be valuable to an attacker.
3. The first step of enumeration is to conduct a port scan, to find out as much information as you can about the services, applications, structure and operating system of the target machine.
