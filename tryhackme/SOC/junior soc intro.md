The responsibilities for a Junior Security Analyst or Tier 1 SOC Analyst include:
- Monitor and investigate the alerts (most of the time, it's a 24x7 SOC operations environment)
- Configure and manage the security tools
- Develop and implement basic [IDS (Intrusion Detection System)](https://www.barracuda.com/glossary/intrusion-detection-system) signatures
- Participate in SOC working groups, meetings
- Create tickets and escalate the security incidents to the Tier 2 and Team Lead if needed

Required qualifications (most common):
- 0-2 years of experience with Security Operations
- Basic understanding of Networking ( OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) or  TCP/IP model (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol Model)), Operating Systems (Windows, Linux), Web applications.
- Scripting/programming skills are a plus

Desired certification:

- CompTIA Security+

As you progress and advance your skills as a Junior Security Analyst, you will eventually move up to Tier 2 and Tier 3.

An overview of the Security Operations Center (SOC) Three-Tier Model:

**Security Operations Center**
   - The core function of a SOC (Security Operations Center) is to investigate, monitor, prevent, and respond to threats in the cyber realm 24/7 or around the clock.

**Preparation and Prevention**
   - As a Junior Security Analyst, you should stay informed of the current cyber security threats.
   - Prevention methods include gathering intelligence data on the latest threats, threat actors, and their [TTPs](https://www.optiv.com/explore-optiv-insights/blog/tactics-techniques-and-procedures-ttps-within-cyber-threat-intelligence) [(Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures)](https://www.optiv.com/explore-optiv-insights/blog/tactics-techniques-and-procedures-ttps-within-cyber-threat-intelligence).
   - It also includes the maintenance procedures like updating the firewall signatures, patching the vulnerabilities in the existing systems, block-listing and safe-listing applications, email addresses, and IPs.

**Monitoring and Investigation**
   - A SOC team proactively uses [SIEM (Security information and event management)](https://www.fireeye.com/products/helix/what-is-siem-and-how-does-it-work.html) and [EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)](https://www.mcafee.com/enterprise/en-us/security-awareness/endpoint/what-is-endpoint-detection-and-response.html) tools to monitor suspicious and malicious network activities.
   - As a Security Analyst, you will learn how to prioritise the alerts based on their level: Low, Medium, High, and Critical.
   - You will get a chance to monitor the network traffic, including IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) and IDS (Intrusion Detection System) alerts, suspicious emails, extract the forensics data to analyze and detect the potential attacks, use open-source intelligence to help you make the appropriate decisions on the alerts.

**Response**
   - After the investigation, the SOC team coordinates and takes action on the compromised hosts, which involves isolating the hosts from the network, terminating the malicious processes, deleting files, and more.
