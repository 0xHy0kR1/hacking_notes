**Command Injection can be detected in mostly one of two ways:**
1. Blind command injection
2. Verbose command injection

## Detecting Blind Command Injection
- Blind command injection is when command injection occurs; however, there is no output visible, so it is not immediately noticeable. For example, a command is executed, but the web application outputs no message.
- For this type of command injection, we will need to use payloads that will cause some time delay. For example, the `ping` and `sleep` commands are significant payloads to test with.
- Using `ping` as an example, the application will hang for _x_ seconds in relation to how many _pings_ you have specified.
- Another method of detecting blind command injection is by forcing some output. This can be done by using redirection operators such as `>`. For example, we can tell the web application to execute commands such as `whoami` and redirect that to a file.

**Note** - The `curl`Â command is a great way to test for command injection.

## Detecting Verbose Command Injection
- Verbose command injection is when the application gives you feedback or output as to what is happening or being executed.
- For example, the output of commands such as `ping` or `whoami` is directly displayed on the web application.
