- Command injection is the abuse of an application's behaviour to execute commands on the operating system, using the same privileges that the application on a device is running with.
- For example, achieving command injection on a web server running as a user named `joe` will execute commands under this `joe` user - and therefore obtain any permissions that `joe` has.
- A command injection vulnerability is also known as a "Remote Code Execution" (RCE).
- For example, being able to abuse an application to perform the command `whoami` to list what user account the application is running will be an example of command injection.
