- Reverse image search is one of the most well-known and easiest digital investigative techniques, with two-click functionality of choosing “Search Google for image” in many web browsers.
- Uploading a photograph in its original form to just images.google.com may give you useful results for the most obviously stolen or popular images, but for most any sophisticated research project, you need additional sites along with lots of creativity.

## Beyond Google
   - The first and most important piece of advice on this topic cannot be stressed enough: Google reverse image search isn’t very good.
   - the undisputed leader of reverse image search is the Russian site **[Yandex](http://yandex.com/images)**. After Yandex, the runners-up are Microsoft’s **[Bing](http://images.bing.com)** and **[Google](http://images.google.com)**.
   - A fourth service that could also be used in investigations is **[TinEye](http://tineye.com)**, but this site specializes in intellectual property violations and looks for exact duplicates of images.

## Yandex
   - Yandex is by far the best reverse image search engine, with a scary-powerful ability to recognize faces, landscapes, and objects.
   - This Russian site draws heavily upon user-generated content, such as tourist review sites (e.g. FourSquare and TripAdvisor) and social networks (e.g. dating sites), for remarkably accurate results with facial and landscape recognition queries.

>To use Yandex, go to [images.yandex.com](http://images.yandex.com), then choose the camera icon on the right.

**From there, you can either upload a saved image or type in the URL of one hosted online.**

If you get stuck with the Russian user interface, look out for **Выберите файл** (Choose file), **Введите адрес картинки** (Enter image address), and **Найти** (Search). After searching, look out for **Похожие картинки** (Similar images), and **Ещё похожие** (More similar).

##### Example
![[reverse_img3.png]]
   - Yandex found numerous photographs of Dubinsky from various sources (only two of the top results had unrelated people), with the result differing from the original image but showing the same person.
   - Google had no luck at all, while Bing had a single result (fifth image, second row) that also showed Dubinsky.

## Bing
  - Bing’s “Visual Search”, found at [images.bing.com](http://images.bing.com), is very easy to use, and offers a few interesting features not found elsewhere.
