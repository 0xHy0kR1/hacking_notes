## Introduction
- A database is controlled by a DBMS which is an acronym forÂ  Database Management System.
- DBMS's fall into two camps **Relational** or **Non-Relational**
**Relational databases** - 
MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, PostgreSQL and SQLite.
**Non-Relational database** - 
MongoDB, Cassandra and ElasticSearch.

## What are tables?
- A table is made up of columns and rows, a useful way to imagine a table is like a grid with the columns going across the top from left to right containing the name of the cell and the rows going from top to bottom with each one having the actual data.

### Columns:
- When creating a column, you also set the type of data it will contain, common ones being integer (numbers), strings (standard text) or dates.

### Rows:
- Rows or records are what contains the individual lines of data.
- When you add data to the table, a new row/record is created, and when you delete data, a row/record is removed.

## Relational Vs Non-Relational Databases:
**Relational database** - 
A relational database, stores information in tables and often the tables have shared information between them, they use columns to specify and define the data being stored and rows to actually store the data.

**Non-Relational database** - 
- Non-relational databases sometimes called NoSQL on the other hand is any sort of database that doesn't use tables, columns and rows to store the data.
- a specific database layout doesn't need to be constructed so each row of data can contain different information which can give more flexibility over a relational database.
