## Introduction
- Bash allows you to run commands within commands(inline commands).
- This is useful for many reasons, but in our case, it will be used to inject a command within the server.
- To execute inline commands, you only need to enclose them in the following formatÂ `$(your_command_here)`.
- If the console detects an inline command, it will execute it first and then use the result as the parameter for the outer command.
- Look at the following example, which runs `whoami` as an inline command inside an `echo` command:

**here are some other commands you may want to try:**
- whoami
- id
- ifconfig/ip addr
- uname -a
- ps -ef
