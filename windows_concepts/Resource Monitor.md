- Resource Monitor displays per-process CPU, memory, disk, and network usage information.
- Short for **Resource Monitor**, **Resmon** is a feature introduced with [Windows Vista](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/v/vista.htm) that enables users to view [real-time](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/r/realtime.htm) resource information about software and hardware on their computer.
- It shows things like memory, disk, CPU and network performance, and which software [handles](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/h/handles.htm) and file [modules](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/m/module.htm) are working.
**Resource Monitor is found in the Task Manager under the “Performance” tab.
It can also be found by typing “resmon” into the Windows search box**
