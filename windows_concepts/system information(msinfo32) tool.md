## Introduction
- Windows includes a tool called Microsoft System Information (Msinfo32.exe).
- This tool gathers information about your computer and displays a comprehensive view of your hardware, system components, and software environment, which you can use to diagnose computer issues.

**TheÂ  information in System Summary is divided into three sections:**
- Hardware Resources
- Components
- Software Environment

**Environment variables**
- Environment variables store information about the operating system environment.
- This information includes details such as the operating system path, the number of processors used by the operating system, and the location of temporary folders.
For example, the WINDIR environment variable contains the location of the Windows installation directory. Programs can query the value of this variable to determine where Windows operating system files are located

**Click on `Environment Variables` to see the assigned values for the virtual machine**
